Idea 2: We need to create more opportunities for people to learn
There are many ways that people can learn new things. Some people learn through books, others through conversation, and still others through online resources. In order to create more opportunities for people to learn, we should consider creating more interactive learning experiences. These experiences could include:
-Teams: A team learning experience is a great way for students to work together and learn from one another.Team building activities can be used in a variety of ways, such asctoring lectures or discussing research papers with classmates.

-Video Lessons: Adding video lessons into classrooms can help students learn by watching it instead of reading it. This type of learning is convenient because students have time to stop and watch the lesson while they are working on other tasks.

-Blogs: Blogging can be a great way for students to share their ideas, thoughts, and experiences with others.

What To Do When You Have an Idea: What to do with it?
There are a few things you can do when you have an idea for something to do. The first is to make sure that it's something that you're interested in, and second is to see if there's anyone who can help you with it. If you don't have any help from others, or if someone you know is already working on something similar, the third step is to come up with a plan of how you'll go about doing it. The fourth step is to make sure that your idea is something that people will want to do. If your idea isn't something people are excited about, they might not be willing to invest time and energy into it. The fifth step is to find someone who can helpyou execute your idea. This could be someone who has experience in the field, or someone who can helpyou come up with more specific ideas.

What are some new ideas?
There are a lot of new ideas out there these days. Here are some of the most popular: 
1) Introduction to computer programming – This is a new course that has been moderately successful in increasing interest in computer science. It covers everything from basic coding to more complex topics, making it an excellent introduction to the field for those who want to start homebrewing or develop their own software projects. 
2) A way for people with mental health conditions to interact with the world – This is a trend that is growing slowly but surely, as more and more people realize just how important it is for people with mental health conditions to have access to support and information (and not just be left on their own). Some companies are starting to create websites and apps specifically for people with mental health conditions, so this trend is only going to continue growing.
