The future of transportation
The future of transportation is packed with potential. Some of the ideas being floated include: driverless cars, totally autonomous transportation, and even flying cars. All of these projects have a lot of potential to improve our quality of life and save us money in the long run. But how do you go about making these ideas a reality? And what are some early steps that could help make them a reality? Here are four tips: 
1. Start with small steps 
If you want to see large-scale transportation projects take off, it’s important to start with small steps. This means taking things like creating bike lanes or getting single-occupancy vehicles registered on the road. It also means looking at ways to reduce congestion and improve safety. 
2. Get involved in community deliberations 
Community deliberations are key in helping to create successful transportation projects.

Creative juices: How creativity flows through our veins
Creativity is one of the most powerful forces in our lives. It can help us see things in a new way, inspire us to create, and connect with others. But just how creativity flows through our veins? And what role does it play in our lives?
According to a study by University of Edinburgh researchers, creativity is passed down from parents to children through their blood pressure levels. When the parents had high blood pressure levels, they were more creative than when they had low blood pressure levels. This finding suggests that creativity is a natural part of human nature and can be passed down through the generations.

Other studies have also shown that creativity is connected with stress levels. If people are under stress, they are less creative than if they are not under stress. This suggests that stress can influence how creative we become.
