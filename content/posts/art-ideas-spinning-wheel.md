What are some ideas?
When it comes to ideas, no one is an expert. Everyone has different ideas and opinions on what should be done, which is why it's important to have a general idea of what you're looking for when coming up with ideas. Here are some key tips to help you get started:
1. Consider the audience: What will the idea be effective for? Is it for a small group of people, or a large one? What are their needs and wants?

2. Think about potential solutions: Once you've determined who or what your target audience is, consider what problems could be solved by using the given idea. Are there any potential drawbacks or challenges associated with this solution that you didn't account for? If so, these should be considered indepth before finally coming up with a plan.

How to generate Big Ideas: How do you generate big ideas?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to generate big ideas, but there are a few key things to keep in mind. The first is that different people have different ways of generating ideas. Some people prefer to think out loud, while others prefer writing down their thoughts. It doesn’t matter what type of idea you come up with – just be sure that it’s something that you can actually put into action and make a difference in your life. 
The second thing to note is that big ideas don’t always have to come from scratch. Sometimes, you can take what you know and use it to help develop new ideas. For example, if you know that you could improve your business by creating more customer service skills, then you might want to start thinking about how you can do this.

The critical thinking process in art
Creative artists use a variety of critical thinking processes in order to create their work. These processes can include brainstorming, design, and analysis. They need to be aware of the different aspects of their work that can affect its quality, and they need to be able to identify potential problems with it before they start working on it.

Creative process: How does creativity work?
Creativity is often thought of as a process, rather than an event. creativity begins with the idea, and then the creative artist goes on to create something unique and amazing from that idea. This creative process often includes brainstorming, designing, testing, refining, and sometimes even reworking ideas until they are finally created.
