Types of creativity: Presentation, Idea, Solution, Legacy
Creativity is a vast and ever-changing field. The following are three types of creativity: presentation, idea, and solution. Presentation creativity is the ability to create an effective and catchy presentation that stands out from the competition. Idea creativity is the invention of new solutions to problems that have been faced before. Solution creativity comes in handy when there is no existing solution that can be found. It is the creative rendering of a problem into a solved entity. Legacy creativity is the retention of your ideas after they are finished, whether it be for future use or just to keep them safe and stored away in your brain for future reference.

Types of creativity: Abstract, Functional, Symbolic.
Creative arts are any art that is based on the creative process. These artists use their creativity to create something new and original. Creative arts can be found in all genres, but some are more popular than others. There are several different types of creative arts, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
Functional art is often seen as the most creative type of creative art. It is based on simply completing a task or completing a goal. Functional artists are usually able to see the world in a specific way and they don’t need much inspiration to create their work.

 Symbolic art is often seen as the second most creative type of artistic creation. This type of artist uses symbols to represent ideas or concepts that they want to communicate through their artwork.
