Nice ideas are a great way to make a great product. By using nice ideas, you can increase the chances of success for your project. Here are five tips to help you use nice ideas to create a successful product:
1. Start with common problems and solutions. When you start with a problem or solution, you’re more likely to find common ground and develop an idea that everybody can understand.
