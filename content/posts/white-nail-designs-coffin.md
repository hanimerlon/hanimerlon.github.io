Creative ways to get ideas from others have been around for centuries. Some people find inspiration in nature, others through friends, and still others through creativity itself. Sometimes all you need are a few good ideas and some creativity will come naturally. Here are four creative ways to get ideas from others: 
1) Talk to your friends- prospective clients or customers can be great sources of inspiration when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Ask them what they think, what they’ve done that has inspired them, and see what you can borrow from their work. This could lead to new business opportunities or outright invention!

The benefits of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is often thought of as a noun, referring to the act or process of producing something new. However, creativity can also be seen as a verb, referring to the act or process of coming up with ideas, concepts and solutions.

When you have an idea that is different than what others have tried before, it can be helpful to bring your own ideas to the table and see if they are able to work together. This allows for creative thinking and problem solving, which can lead to innovative ideas and products. 2. Creativity can help you build relationships with other people.
