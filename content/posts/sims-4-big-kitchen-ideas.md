Creative Process: What goes into creative thinking?
Creative thinking is the process of coming up with new and innovative ideas. It can be difficult to know where to start, but here are a few tips to get started: 
1. Be open to new ideas: When you're brainstorming for new ideas, be willing to change your mind a lot. If you're not sure what something could be, give it a try. You may find that something you thought was impossible is actually possible. 

2. Be persistent: Don't give up on your ideas just because they seem hard or too risky. Keep trying until you come up with something that works and that you're satisfied with. This can take time and effort, but it's worth it in the end!

Trends in social media: How will people communicate and share their ideas?
New trends in social media continue to emerge, and many people are exploring the various platforms to share their ideas. These days, it's not difficult to find a message or idea that can be shared on social media. However, there are some key considerations that should be made when creating content for social media. 
One of the most important things to remember when sharing content on social media is to keep it concise and to the point. Many people are used to reading long paragraphs or posts, so it's important that the author is clear and concise in what they're saying. Additionally, it's important to make sure that all of your content is original and not copied from other sources. If you want your content to stand out from the rest, you need to create something new and unique.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can be hard to come by. Here are some tips on finding big ideas that will help you succeed: 
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. Once you have a clear idea of what your business wants to accomplish, it's easier to come up with ideas for how to achieve it. 
2. Think about who your target market is. Big businesses often think about their target market as all the people who are potential customers or employees who might be interested in their product or service. However, there are also many people out there who don't have a specific interest in your product or service, and you need to include them in your thinking while developing your big idea. 
3. Create a vision and mission statement.
