What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, so it can be hard to know which ones to pursue. Here are some tips on how to find inspiration: 
-Look at what people have already done. This includes looking at art, design, and architecture. Try to see how they have created things that you like and then apply those ideas to your project. 
-Try different methods of creating something new. Use pens, pencils, paper, paints, or clay to create new things. Not everything needs to be composed in words. 
-Think outside the box. Sometimes all you need is a new perspective to start fresh and get inspired.

What is creative art and why should we care?
Creative art is a form of art that is inspired by or based on imagination or creativity. It can be considered an expression of ideas and feelings, and can be used to communicate with others or to entertain oneself. There are many different kinds of creative art, but the most popular ones are painting, sculpture, photography, music, and poetry. Creative artists often use their creative abilities to express their own thoughts and feelings, and to make something that is unique and beautiful. There are many reasons why people should care about creative art, and they include the following: 
1) It can help you learn more about yourself. When you understand how other people's creative processes work, you can begin to develop your own. This will help you become more self-determined and independent, which is important for both personal growth and career development.

1) Use green heating devices – Green devices like home fans, incandescent light bulbs, and solar chargers can help reduce your home's energy consumption by up to 20%.

2) Ventilate your home regularly – When it’s hot outside, open windows and let the cool air flow through every room. This will help keep your house cooler and more comfortable all year round.

Types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, and gestural.
Creativity is a two-fold process. There are creative visual and auditory experiences, as well as creative gestural experiences. Gestural creativity refers to the ability to create unique or innovative designs through the use of gestures. Gestural creativity can be seen in artists such as Michelangelo and Vincent van Gogh, who were known for their innovation in artistry. Visual creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using their eyesight and vision. This can be seen in paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Caravaggio’s The Nude Descending from the Cross, and Picasso’s Guernica. Artists use their eyesight to see what they want to create, and then use their imagination to make it real. Audiogenic creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using sound instead of sight.
