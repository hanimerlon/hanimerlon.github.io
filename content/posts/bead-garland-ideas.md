What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from your ideas for a song to a way to improve the efficiency of your office. Sometimes the simplest things can make a big impact, and that's what makes creativity so powerful. So if you're looking for ways to turn your creative juices into new ideas, here are some great starting points: 
1. Try out different ways of presenting information. Not everyone is used to reading with an eye-level view, so try different methods and see which ones work best for you.

2. Invent something new or come up with an idea that's never been done before. There's nothing like taking on a challenge and seeing how well you can do it!

3. Take on a task that's currently too daunting or impossible for someone else.

The benefits of creativity
Creativity is not only about being different; it’s about being better. It’s about problem-solving, and thinking outside the box. And it’s a skill that can be learned. Here are three benefits of being more creative:
1. You’ll be better at problem-solving.

When you have to come up with an original solution to a problem, you need to be able to think creatively. This means looking at the problem from different angles, and considering unconventional solutions.

2. You’ll be more successful in your career.

More and more employers are valuing creativity in the workplace. They know that employees who can think creatively are more likely to come up with new ideas, solve problems and drive innovation.
