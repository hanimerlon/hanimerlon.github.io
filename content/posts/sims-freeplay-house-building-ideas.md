What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of change that occurs in any business or organization. Innovation can be defined as the ability to create new and better ways to do something. Innovation can also include the addition of new ideas, products, services, or even business models. Every business has room for growth and innovation if done correctly. However, there are some steps businesses must take in order to achieve success with innovation.
One important step in achieving success with innovation is understanding your customers. You need to understand what they want and how you can provide it to them. Once you know this, you can begin developing innovative ideas that will help your customers achieve their goals.

Another step businesses must take is creating a positive customer feedback loop.

What are big ideas?
Big Ideas are ideas that are so large, they can't be crammed into a small amount of time. They can take up a lot of thought and effort, but they have the potential to change the world. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A universal basic income. This is an idea that has been around for years, but it is still not widely accepted. It would be money that is given to everyone regardless of their income, so it would not depend on fertility rates or any other factors.

2. Education reform. Education is one of the most important aspects of our society and economy, and it needs to be improved in order to make sure everyone can get the education they need.
