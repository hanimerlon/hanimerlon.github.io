The history of invention ideas: How has innovation changed over time?
Invention ideas have changed over time, and as a result, the history of Invention Ideas is reflective of that. One way invention ideas have changed is in how they are created.  In the past, invention ideas were often based on scientific understanding at the time they were conceived. However, as technology advances and new knowledge becomes available, more and more innovation ideas are born from scratch. This new creativity allows for faster response tochanging needs and developments in technology.
One example of this new creativity is the cellular phone. Cellular phones were first invented back in 1984 by American scientist Neil Armstrong and his colleague Rick Stratham. The telephone was originally designed to be a basic communication resource for soldiers in war-time. However, after seeing how useful cellular phones could be for civilians, Armstrong and Stratham decided to create a product that could be used by everyone including business people and everyday citizens.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of making something new, or changing something existing. Innovation can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that it is "the act or process of converting a potential failure into a successful outcome." 
It can be seen as a way to improve the quality and efficiency of an organization's operations, as well as create new opportunities for business growth. 
The key to success in any innovation endeavor is ensuring that the innovation does not detract from the company's primary focus, which may be its core business.
