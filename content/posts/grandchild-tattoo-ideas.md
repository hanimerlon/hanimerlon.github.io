Ideas 1-4:
Ideas 1-4 are a set of ideas that could be used to help plan for the future. These ideas can be used in different situations, so it is important to think about what they would mean for the individual and their business. Some of these ideas include:
1. Creating a plan – This could involve sketching out what the future looks like, as well as what steps need to be taken in order to achieve it. This will help identify any areas where growth could be made and identify any potential risks. 
2. Working on projects – This could involve developing new products or services, or expanding an existing one. It can also involve working on a project that is long-term, rather than just focusing on the present. 
3. Finding new ways to make money – This could involve starting a business or finding new sources of revenue.

The educational process of creativity: How does it happen?
Creativity, or the ability to come up with new ideas and concepts, is an important part of any successful artist. However, the process of creativity can vary depending on how someone is educated. Some people learn how to be creative through art classes or Leroy Sizemore’s The Creative Process. Others learn it through reading or watching creative minds work. Regardless of how someone learns to be creative, the end goal is the same-to come up with new ideas and concepts that can help them in their artwork and business endeavors.
