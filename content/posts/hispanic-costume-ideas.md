Creative use of space in art: How space can be used to create a new environment for the artist or to convey a message
Creative artists use space to create new environments and communicate their messages. In some cases, the artist uses the space to tests their ideas, in other cases it is used as a dumping ground for materials or inspiration. Regardless of its intended use, creative art relies on the creativity of the artist and the ability to think outside the box.
