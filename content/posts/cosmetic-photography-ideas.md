Ideas for movies: What can you make with your movies?
The possibilities for movies are endless, and there are a number of creative ideas you can use to make them even more special. Here are a few ideas:
1. Use movie footage as the basis for your own short story or novel.
2. Make a movie about your own life and career—or about your favorite movie scenes.
3. Adapt one of your favorite movies into a full-length feature film—or create a new version of an old movie with different music and visuals.
4. Create a retelling of one of your favorite movies based on its original story or setting.
5. Make an American remake or sequel of one of the world's biggest films—or adapt a classic European film into an American release.

The five types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal.
Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal creativity are all important types of creativity. Intuitive creativity is based on the spontaneity of the creative process. Analyses provide a plan or blueprint for creative endeavors. Pluralistic creativity involves using many different ideas to come up with a new solution or project. Formal creativity entails using specific steps and techniques to complete a task or create an outcome. Ultra-formal creativity is based on the limits of what can be done or created. It means taking ideas to their extreme and seeing if there is still something that can be accomplished by pushing boundaries.
