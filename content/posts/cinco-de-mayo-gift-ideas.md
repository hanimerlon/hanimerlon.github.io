The barriers to innovation
Innovation is a key driver of economic growth. It allows firms to create new products and services and find new ways of doing things. However, innovation can be difficult to achieve. Firms face a number of barriers when trying to innovate, including a lack of resources, a risk-averse culture, and an unwillingness to change.
One of the biggest barriers to innovation is a lack of resources. Many firms do not have the money or the manpower to invest in new ideas. They may also lack the necessary skills and knowledge.
