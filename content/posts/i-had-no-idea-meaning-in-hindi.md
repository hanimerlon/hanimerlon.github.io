4) Transform transportation infrastructure
Transportation infrastructure is important for both people and businesses. It includes roads, bridges, airports, and other areas that allow people to move around and businesses to run their operations. But as the world moves increasingly towards electric vehicles and other forms of transportation that don't use gasoline or oil, the need for transportation infrastructure will only become more important. 
One way to improve the transportation infrastructure is to create more efficient ways to generate energy. Another way to improve it is to consider how people can be better connected with one another while they are on their way to or from work or school.

2.2 What are some potential solutions to our problem?
One potential solution to our problem is to implement a system where users can be authenticated by their device's unique identifier. This could make it easier for people to avoid being scammed, since they would know who was responsible for a scam when they received an email from someone they didn't expect. Another potential solution is to create more secure passwords and accounts, especially for online services such as social media and online banking. finally, we could work on increasing the security of our vehicles by installing anti-theft devices and tracking their whereabouts.
