What needs to be done to protect our environment?
It is now time for our society to take steps in order to protect our environment. Some ideas that could be put into place include the following:
In order to reduce the amount of plastic that is produced, it would be beneficial for businesses to create waste segregation plans. By segregating a certain type of waste from other waste, businesses can reduce their environmental impact and save money. Businesses also need to consider creating recycling programs in order to help reduce the amount of plastic used in production. This would not only help protect our environment, but also help businesses save money as well. Lastly, we must do everything possible to limit the amount of energy used in manufacturing and promote renewable sources of energy. This will not only help save money on energy bills, but also help protect the environment.

When it comes to ideas, we often think of them as eureka moments - those lightbulb instants when everything comes together and we have that sudden, brilliant realization.
