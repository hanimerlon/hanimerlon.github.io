In a society saturated with information, it can be difficult to find new ideas. Some people believe that the only way to find new ideas is to start from scratch. Others prefer to take existing ideas and improve on them. Still others think that ideas are like seeds - you must water them and let them grow before harvesting them. It all depends on what your goal is.
