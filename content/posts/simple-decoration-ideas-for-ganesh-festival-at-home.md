Definition of art: What is the difference between art and creativity?
Creativity is the ability to come up with ideas and concepts that are new or different from what has been done before. Art, on the other hand, is the creation of art. There are many different definitions of art, but one definition that is often used is "the activity of making something that appeals to the senses." So, while creativity and art can have different meanings, they both involve coming up with new ideas and concepts.

Why are big ideas so important?
Big ideas are the foundation of any great idea, and they can be a driving force behind your innovation. Here are five reasons why big ideas are so important:
1. They build on those that have been done before. A big idea is always new and original, making it easier to come up with new and innovative ideas. This makes it harder for others to copy, which in turn allows you to rest assured that your product or service will be successful.

2. They can help you focus on the right things. When you have a large number of big ideas circling around your head, it can be difficult to know where to start and what to focus on. By having a few big ideas at the forefront of your mind, you can more easily stay focused on what’s important and get the job done rather than trying too many things at once.

Brainstroming is a mental puzzle game that can be played on your computer or phone. Players use their brain to guess the order of cards in a deck, and then put them back in the deck so that the next card is at the bottom. The game is scoreless, but players can win by guessing the order of cards in an opponent's deck and putting them back in place so that their own card is at the top.
