Creative Process: How do we begin to come up with ideas?
Creative process is the process of coming up with ideas. The creative process can be broken down into 5 steps: 1. Brainstorming: This step is where you come up with ideas based on what you’ve heard or seen. It can be helpful to take some time to think about the idea and its potential implications. 2. Crafting: This step is where you come up with a specific plan for how to make your idea a reality. You might need to consider how your idea will impact other people, businesses, or even yourself. 3. Implementation: Once you’ve created a plan and crafted an idea, it’s time for the implementation phase! This includes figuring out how to make your idea a reality and getting your team on board.

What are the best ways to have ideas?
Ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. Without them, startups can't achieve their goals and achieve success. Here are 8 ways to have more ideas:
1. Take a walk around your neighbourhood. This will help you get a mental picture of what your business could look like and how it could Benefit the neighbourhood.
2. Get involved in community activities. Volunteering your time and energy to organisations that you believe in is a great way to get ideas for your business from people who already care about the world you're trying to build for them. 
3. Do some brainstorming with friends or family members. These conversations can help you come up with various concepts for your business, which can then be turned into realisations through brainstorming with others.
