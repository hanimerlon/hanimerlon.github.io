How do inventors go about coming up with new inventions?
Invention ideas are one of the most important aspects of any inventor's toolkit. They can be used to solve problems or make new products. However, coming up with new inventions can be difficult. There are many ways to come up with new inventions, but the most important thing is to think of a solution that you can see happening in the future.
One way to come up with new inventions is to focus on a problem that you know people need and want solved. You can also look at industries that are in your field and see what products or services they currently use or would like to use in the future. Another way to come up with new inventions is by thinking outside the box. You can develop a product idea that isn't currently being used or marketed. This will give you an idea for how you could make your product stand out from the competition.

Definition of creativity: How does creativity differ from regularity?
Creativity is the ability of a person to come up with new and innovative ways to do something. It can be defined in many different ways, but in general, creativity refers to the ability to come up with new and innovative ideas. This varies from person to person, so it really depends on what you're looking for in a definition. However, some key definitions of creativity include: • Artistry: The quality or practice of producing creative works • Innovation: Coming up with anew or novel solutions to problems or challenges • Creativity Loop: A continually evolving process that leads to new ideas and results 
What makes creativity so special? One major factor is that it doesn't always have a standard definition. Unlike regularity, creativity doesn't just involve coming up with new things- it can also involve coming up with ideas that are impossible to accomplish by any other means.
