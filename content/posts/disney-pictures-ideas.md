The benefits of big thinking
If you want to change the world, you have to start by thinking big. That’s the premise behind big thinking: the belief that we can solve problems and create opportunities by coming up with large-scale solutions.
It’s an approach that has yielded some of the most important breakthroughs in history, from the discovery of vaccines to the development of nuclear power. And it’s an approach that is increasingly necessary in a world that is becoming more complex and interconnected.

Big thinking is about more than just coming up with big ideas. It’s also about having the courage to act on those ideas, even when they seem impossible. After all, it was a big thinker who said, “The impossible just takes a little longer.

Overcoming barriers to innovation
Innovation is essential for businesses to maintain a competitive edge, but it can be difficult to encourage employees to think outside the box. Overcoming these barriers is key to promoting a culture of innovation in your organization.
One barrier to innovation is risk aversion. Employees may be hesitant to suggest new ideas for fear of being seen as failures if they don't work out. Encouraging a culture of experimentation can help overcome this hurdle by making it okay to try new things and fail.

Another common barrier is lack of resources. Employees may feel like they don't have the time or money to experiment with new ideas. Providing dedicated resources for innovation can help overcome this obstacle and show employees that you're serious about encouraging creativity.

Finally, some employees may simply be resistant to change. They may be comfortable with the way things are and see no need to innovate.

Limitations of innovation: What are some common limitations to innovation?
The challenges of innovation are well known, but how often do we take the time to understand the limitations of innovation? These limitations can stem from a number of factors, including historical precedent, cultural norms, financial resources, and other constraints.
There are a few key limitations to innovation that should be taken into account when seeking new ideas or concepts:

1. Limitations on creativity: Innovation often comes with a risk of becoming boring or incremental. When trying to come up with new ideas, it is essential to be creative and innovative. However, not all innovations are capable of achieving this level of creativity. In fact, many innovations fall victim to this limit because they lack the ability to surprise or dazzle the audience. This can make it difficult for customers and employees to accept an innovation as new and different than what they have been used to before.
