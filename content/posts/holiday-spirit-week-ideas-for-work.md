How to be more creative
Creativity is key to any successful career. If you can find ways to be more creative, your work will be more valuable and you'll be able to achieve your goals. Here are some tips on how to become more creative: 
1. Make time for yourself. When you're not working, take a break or do something that's outside of your regular routine. This will help you get away from the stress of the day and come back with fresh ideas. 
2. Take breaks when needed. When you're working hard, it's easy to get wrapped up in the task at hand and don't have time for anything else. However, when there's a break in between tasks, you can come back with new ideas and fresh perspective. 
3. Be open to change. Change is Key To Creative Processes!
