Definition of creativity: How do we define creativity?
Creativity is a relative term. Many people believe that creativity = doing something new and original. Others would say it's the ability to come up with ideas or solutions that no one else has thought of before. The definition for creativity has changed over time, but the process remains the same- coming up with new and innovative ways to do things. Whether itâ€™s painting, designing, or writing, creative individuals have always been able to bring their A game to whatever they do.
