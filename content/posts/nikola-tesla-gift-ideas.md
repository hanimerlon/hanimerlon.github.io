How do we turn creativity into results?
In order to be creative, you need to have a clear idea of what you want to create. If you don't know what it is that you're trying to create, it's hard to get started. Sometimes creativity can come from just taking ideas and turning them into something real. Sometimes all you need is a good starting point, and then you can start creating things from there.

The downside of having invention ideas: They take time and effort
Invention ideas are a dime a dozen. But turning an invention idea into a reality takes time, money and effort.
Many would-be inventors never take the first step because they don't know where to start or they are afraid of failure.

There is no guarantee that your invention will be a success. In fact, most inventions never make it to market. Even if your invention is successful, you may not see any financial return on your investment for years, if at all.

Invention ideas can be anything from a new way to make a product or service more efficient, to a better way to store food. Sometimes, the best ideas come from scratch – when an inventor has a great idea for something that nobody else has thought of. For example, in the medical world, many people are still surprised by how often diseases sneak up on people unawares. A doctor might come up with a new treatment for cancer that nobody else knew about.
