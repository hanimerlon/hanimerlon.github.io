What are some of the challenges you face when trying new ideas?
There are a number of challenges that can come about when trying new ideas. Some of these challenges may include: difficulty in getting others to embrace the idea, derailed progress because of creative differences, and confusion over what is truly important when it comes to implementing the idea. However, even if these obstacles don't seem insurmountable, they can still cause setbacks and make it difficult to see the value in pursuing an idea. It's important to remember that ideas are worth pursuing, regardless of the obstacles that may be encountered along the way. So whether you're facing difficulty adapting or disagreement over how best to use an 8-bit game as your business model, remember that ideas are worth fighting for.
