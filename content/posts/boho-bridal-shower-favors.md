The Power of Idea: How do we get the most out of our ideas?
Ideas are the lifeblood of any business and creativity. From businesses to creativity, ideas can be the key to success. Here are five tips on how to get the most out of your ideas:
1. Define what you want your idea to achieve. Without a clear goal, it will be much harder to motivate yourself to work on it. define your idea in broad terms and break it down into smaller steps that you can complete easily. This will help you stay focused on the task at hand and avoid getting lost in the weeds.

2. Take a step back and ask yourself why you think this concept or product is necessary or valuable. Once you have a good reason for your idea, it becomes easier to focus on developing it further and writing marketability plans accordingly.

Creative ideas can be anything from the creative process itself, to how to go about creating something new. Whether you're looking for inspiration for a new quilt or a new painting, there are many ways to find creative solutions. Here are just a few examples: 
- Make your own puzzle book: This is an excellent way to get more out of your creativity and have some fun while doing it. Start by picking out some interesting puzzles to solve, then make your own book folder that holds the puzzles and their solutions. Once you've made one or two, take them around with you and show people what you've done! 

- Experiment with color: Just as with any other aspect of creativity, there's no one right way to do things. What works for one person might not work for another.
