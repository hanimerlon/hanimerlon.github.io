The different types of creative art
There are many different types of creative art. Some people may think of art as paintings in a museum, while others may think of it as the music they listen to on the radio. Creative art can be anything that someone creates that is intended to be beautiful or expressive. Here are some of the different types of creative art:
Painting: Painting is one of the most popular forms of creative art. People have been painting for centuries, and there are many different styles and techniques that can be used.
