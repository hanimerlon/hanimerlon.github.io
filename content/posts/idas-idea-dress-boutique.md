What are the challenges of having big ideas?
There are a few key challenges that come with having big ideas, according to Jason Fried. Fried is the author of The Lean Startup, a book on how to build successful startups. In his book, he discusses how it can be tough to stay creative and keep up with new ideas when your mind is constantly filled with too many thoughts. 
One challenge is that it can be hard to remember what you just thought of. Another is that it can be difficult to get your thoughts down in writing form. Finally, Fried says that it can be hard to see the big picture when you're thinking about individual products or services.

Summary: What are some tips for staying creative in the workplace?
Creativity is key to staying creative in the workplace. There are a few pieces of advice that can help you be more productive and innovative. Here are some tips:
1. Find ways to get out of your comfort zone. When you’re stuck in a rut, try going against the grain and trying something new. This will force you to think outside the box and come up with ideas that may not have been considered before.

2. Be open to feedback. If you’re not sure what someone thinks of your work, give them some feedback and see how they react. It can help you determine if your ideas need refinement or if they work well on their own.

3. Take time for yourself breaks.

Creativity and art: What are the benefits?
Creativity and art are two of the most important aspects of life. Whether it is working on a painting or writing a story, creativity is needed to create something new. However, there are some disadvantages to having great creativity. First, often times creativity can be difficult to control. Second, with great creativity comes a lot of risk. For example, if you don't have a good eye for color or if you make mistakes while painting, your work might not look as good as it could. But overall, the benefits of creativity far outweigh any negatives. So whether you're looking for an outlet to express yourself or just want to have fun, creative art is worth exploring!
