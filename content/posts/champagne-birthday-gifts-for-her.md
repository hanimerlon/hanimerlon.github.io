Creative tools and techniques: What makes creativity so special?
Creativity is a complex and subjective concept, but there are some general principles that can underlie its definition. One of these principles is the ability to see things in a new way. This skill is often used to come up with new ideas or solutions for problems. Another principle is the ability to take risks. When creativity flourishes, it can lead to new ideas, products, or even services that are better than those that were available before.

Invention: What are the different types of inventions?
Invention is the process of creating something new, using an original idea or design. Patent and trade mark are the two most common types of invention. Patent covers a specific invention, while trade mark covers a particular name or symbol that is used by someone else. There are many different types of inventions, but these are the most common:
Patents: A patent is a document that shows that someone has invented a specific product or service. The patent can cover any kind of product or service, from a simple invention to a very complex one.

Trade marks: Trade marks are similar to patents, but they cover specific names or symbols that are used by someone else instead of just products. Trade marks can be registered with the trade mark office and they can be used on products and services.
