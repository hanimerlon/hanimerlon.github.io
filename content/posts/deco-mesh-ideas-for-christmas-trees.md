How can we develop big ideas?
In order to develop big ideas, we need to think about what we want to achieve. What does this mean for our businesses and our society? It means that we need to come up with solutions that solve real-world problems. When we do this, we can start to see the potential for big things.
There are a few ways that we can approach this: brainstorming, breaking down complex topics into manageable chunks, and coming up with original ideas. All of these methods can help us uncover new solutions and insights that could be helpful for our businesses and our societies.

However, it’s important not to forget about creativity. We all have room for creativity when it comes to problem solving and coming up with new ideas. In fact, many businesses use creativity as a way of inspiring their employees and customers alike.

Cultural aspects of Invention: How do people React to Innovation?
When someone comes up with a new invention, people often react in different ways. Some people may be excited by the idea, while others may be skeptical. Still others may just be curious. Different reactions mean that different people have different perspectives on innovation. 
One example of how people react to innovation is through patenting. Patenting an invention means that somebody has made something that is exclusive to them and can't be copied or used by anyone else. This can help protect the inventor's work from being copied or used without permission. 

Another example of how people react to innovation is through creativity. When somebody comes up with a new idea, they may be inspired by it or they might not be. It all depends on the person and their perspective on innovation.

Creative art in the contemporary world: What challenges does creativity face in the 21st century?
Creativity is facing new challenges in the 21st century. One of the most important aspects of creativity is the ability to process information. Many modern day technologies have made it easier for people to get information and create artistry without having to leave their homes. However, this has also created some challenges for creatives. For example, many people no longer need to go outside to experience nature. They can now access creative content online or on screens all around them. This has created a problem for creatives, as they are no longer able to experience the natural environment around them. The other challenge creatives face is that technology has not always been accurate when it comes to depicting real life events and scenes. For example, many people believe that Trump was elected president because he had an "impenetrable" wall with Mexico. However, this is not accurate at all.
