Brainstorming: How do you come up with creative ideas?
Creative brainstorming is a process of coming up with ideas that can help solve problems or achieve goals. It can be helpful to have a group of people who are familiar with the problem or goal in question and who can help you come up with potential solutions. One way to come up with creative ideas is to list the problem or goal, then list possible solutions that could work for the problem or goal. Other ways to come up with ideas include asking others for their suggestions, looking at examples of how other people have solved similar problems, and using your own creativity to come up with new ideas.
