HistoricalBackground: Invention refers to the use of new ideas or devices to improve or complete a task.
Invention is the use of new ideas or devices to improve or complete a task. The history of invention is filled with stories of people who came up with new ways to do things, and often these ideas led to new products, services, or treatments. Today, we continue to see innovation in all areas of life, from technology to fashion. In some cases, this has led to profound change for the world around us - for example, the development of the printing press and the telephone. In other cases, it has just meant more innovation in the ways we work and live.

The Benefits of Thinking Out Loud: How to get started
With so many things going on in our lives, it can be difficult to focus. It's easy to forget that we have the power to think and change the world. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
1) Get organized. When you're not focusing, it can be difficult to stay on track with your goals. Make a list of your top accomplishments and objective, and then find ways to achieve them through effort and planning. 
2) Take action. Sometimes all it takes is taking some action towards your objective- even if it's just writing down what you plan to do next. This will help keep you motivated as well as give yourself an idea of how far you've come already. 
3)「What if?」 Thinking about possibilities can help increase your confidence when making decisions.
