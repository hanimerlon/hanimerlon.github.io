What are the benefits of big ideas?
Big ideas can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing and help you come up with new ideas. There are a number of benefits to big ideas, including increase productivity, increased creativity, and more efficient thinking. Here are four examples:
1. Big ideas can lead to new solutions to old problems. When you have a big idea, you can start by thinking about what other people have already tried and found successful. This will give you new insights that could solve the problem at hand.

2. Big ideas can free up time for you to focus on your own work instead of othersâ€™ work. When you have a lot of big ideas in your head, it can be difficult to focus on your own projects. Instead of struggling with each one, working on a few big ones will free up time for you to achieve the rest of your goals.

The definition of invention has changed over time
Invention is an act or process of creating a new product or service from scratch. The definition of invention has changed over time, and the definition of what constitutes an invention has also changed.  In 1876, the International Convention on Patents gave a definitive definition of an invention: "A new production method, composition, use or application of any natural or artificial material." 
However, in 1992, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) revised its rules on what constituted an invention. Previously, inventions were considered to be "natural phenomena" that had not been produced by man. However, under this revision, "natural phenomena" no longer had to be novel; they could just be useful products that had not been used before.
