Conclusion: Some ways to come up with creative ideas.
Creative ideas are aplenty, but sometimes they don't come easy. You have to be willing to think outside the box and come up with new ways to do things. Here are some ways to come up with creative ideas: 
1. Take on a new project: This can be something as small as creating a new design for your business cards or as large as starting your own business. It doesn't have to be anything that you're exclusively good at – it could be something that you're curious about and haven't tried before. Everything counts! 
2. Lead an experiment: One of the best ways to come up with creative ideas is to lead an experiment. This means starting off by thinking about what you're not doing and trying something different instead.

the nature of innovation and how it leads to change
Innovation is a central part of the puzzle that leads to change. It’s a process of taking something that’s working well and making it better. Innovation can be seen in everything from products to services to business models. But what makes innovation work is often more difficult than people think. Here are four examples of how innovation can lead to big changes in our world.
1) New technologies lead to new ways of doing things. When you introduce a new technology into an industry, you may see companies come up with new ways of doing things such as creating digital products or services that are easier and faster to use than ever before. This can change the way customers approach their businesses, and it can also lead to new markets for products and services.

2) Innovative business models help companies find new ways to make money.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything you want them to be. It doesn't have to be something that's necessarily new, but something that will help your business or product stand out. Below are some ideas to get you started:
1. Create a Logo
A logo is the foundation of any business or product. A well- designed and executed logo can help make a company recognizable and sell its products. If you don't have a strong logo, consider hiring someone to create one for you.

2. Come up with a Unique Text Message
Text messages are an effective way to communicate with your customers and promote your business. They're also great for spreading the word about your product or service in a unique way. Find creative ways to send text messages that will resonate with customers and help build relationships with them.
