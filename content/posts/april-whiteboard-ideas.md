The difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions: Some key distinctions.
Some people might define brainstorming as coming up with ideas, while others might say that brainstorming is actually coming up with solutions to problems. In either case, the main difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions lies in how the two activities are done.
In terms of how brainstorming is typically done, participants put together a list of ideas and then work on developing one or more possible solutions. This usually happens in small groups, which allows for each person to share their ideas and receive feedback.

Coming up with solutions, on the other hand, is typically a more solitary process. Participants typically work on tackle one or a few problems at a time and then come up with a plan to achieve their goals. Sometimes this occurs in group settings, but most times it’s best if someone alone comes up with the solution to a problem.

The Different Types of Ideas: What are they and what do they mean for business?
Ideas can be defined in a few ways. The most popular definition is "A mental or creative concept that has the potential to make something happen." Ideas are something businesses need in order to think of new ways to approach their problems and come up with new solutions.

- Service: This is the idea of what a service is and how it works. It could be anything from providing customer support to doing your own research for an assignment. 
- Territory: This is the idea of who owns or controls a certain area of space or time.
