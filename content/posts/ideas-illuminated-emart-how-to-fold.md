Invention is the act of bringing a new product to the market, or making a change in an old product so that it can be successful. It is often credited to individuals, gangs, and governments who come up with new ideas for fixing things or improving society. Invention has been a part of human history for as long as people have been able to think about it. The ancient Greeks were the first to develop inventive minds and come up with new products.

The definition of creativity: What is creativity?
Creativity is an important word. It has been used to describe many different things in the past, but its meaning has changed over time. In ancient Greece, creativity was defined as making something new. This idea wasn't widely accepted by people at that time, but it is still used today. In the modern world, creativity is often used to describe how something can be done or how something can be created. However, there is no one definition of creativity. There are many different ways to think about creativity, and each person has their own definition. Some people define creativity as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. Others may think of it as the ability to see things differently orto come up with unique solutions to problems. Still others may believe that creativity isn't about anything specific but simply creative thought and problem solving.
