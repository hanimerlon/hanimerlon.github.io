what is innovation?
Innovation is a term used to describe the application of new ideas, methods or products. It includes both the process of creating new ideas and the implementation of those ideas into practice. Innovation is often used in business to refer to the process of introducing new products or services. However, it can also refer to improving existing products or services, as well as developing new processes or ways of doing things.
There are many different types of innovation, but all share a common goal: to create something new or improve upon something that already exists. The process of innovation typically begins with an idea. This can come from anywhere – an individual, a team, a company, or even a country. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed and tested before it can be implemented. This process can take years, and sometimes even decades, to complete.

What are some invention ideas?
Invention ideas are endless, and we never know what will come next. From new medications to innovative ways of manufacturing products, there are many potential inventions that could revolutionize how we live and work. Here are some of the most interesting: 
1. An airtight container that can protect food from spoilage or insects. This could help reduce the amount of food waste produced and save money in the process. 
2. A way to create a self-healing surface for guitars or other instruments. This could make them cheaper and easier to maintain over time, allowing them to last longer without needing to be serviced often. 
3. A new way to produce hydrogen fuel cells using renewable energy sources. This would create a more sustainable option for powering devices, as well as reducing emissions from electric vehicles.
