Innovation is the process of creating a new product or service that is different from the ones currently in use. Innovation can be seen in everything from medical treatments to fashion trends.
There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to innovation.

Second, innovation should be based on customer feedback and not just on what someone thinks is best for their business.
