Brainstroming is a technique used in business to improve decision making. The brainstem is the part of the brain that controls heart rate, breathing, and other basic bodily functions. When a business owner uses brainstroming, they can better understand their customer’s needs and determine what changes need to be made to meet those needs. This allows businesses to make informed decisions, which in turn leads to increased profits.
