Printing press
In 1439, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press, which revolutionized how information was disseminated. For the first time in history, knowledge was not restricted to those who could read and write; it could be shared with anyone who could operate a printing press. The ability to mass-produce printed materials quickly and cheaply made it possible for people to access a wide range of information that was previously only available to a select few.
The invention of the printing press had a profound impact on society. It allowed for the rapid spread of ideas and knowledge, and played a key role in shaping the course of history. Today, the printing press is an essential tool for businesses, schools, and individuals around the world.

History of Invention: How did invention come about?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that had not been considered before. Invention has been around for centuries, and it began with the Greeks. In their manual The Iliad, Homer mentions the invention of the bow and arrow, which he says was created by Menelaus. Other ancient authors also mention the invention of new technologies. For example, Theophrastus wrote about a machine that could turn any object into wine, which he called the “Wine Maker”. The Chinese also invented various products such as silkworm cocoons and books in the 4th century BC.
