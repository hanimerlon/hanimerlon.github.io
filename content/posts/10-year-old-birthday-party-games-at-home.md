The role of technology in promoting innovation?
Technology has often been seen as a facilitator of innovation, with the ability to help organizations make faster and more efficient decisions. However, recent studies have shown that technology can also be used in an adversarial role, promoting innovation in the wrong direction. For example, Google was found to be using its search engine to promote its own products instead of those of other companies. In other cases, such as Apple's use of advertising to convince users to buy their products instead of competitors', technology can actually hinder innovation by creating a rift between different factions within an organization.

Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product. This can be done through a lot of different ways, but often the best way to come up with an invention is to think outside the box. Some people might say that invention is what makes us human, and it is something that allows us to create things that we never thought possible.

The difference between creativity and art: What are the essential differences?
Creativity, or the ability to think outside the box, is one of the most essential traits for a successful artist. Because creativity is so important, it can be hard to determine which category a person falls into when it comes to art.Some people may see creativity as simply coming up with new ideas or concepts; while others could see creativity as the ability to express oneself in a unique way. It all boils down to what someone considers essential to their artistry.
There are two main categories of creatives- those who come up with ideas and those who create something beautiful. While both types of creatives require some great talent and dedication, there are key differences that set creatives apart from other artists. 

The first difference between creative art and everyday art is that creative art often has a specific purpose or goal in mind.

How to get started with creative art
Creative art is a great way to express yourself. It can be used to communicate your thoughts and feelings, or simply to make something beautiful. There are no rules when it comes to creative art, so you can let your imagination run wild! If you're not sure where to start, here are a few ideas:
1. Experiment with different mediums. There are many different types of creative art, from painting and drawing to sculpture and photography. Don't be afraid to try out new mediums and see what you like best.

2. Find inspiration everywhere. Inspiration can come from anywhere – nature, architecture, other works of art, etc. Keep your eyes open for things that spark your creativity and use them as a starting point for your own creations.

3. Practice regularly. The more you practice, the better you'll become at creative art.

Creative process: How does the creative artist go about creating their work?
