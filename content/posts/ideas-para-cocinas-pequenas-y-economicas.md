what is creative art?
Creative art is a process of creating something new, whether it’s a painting, sculpture, dance, or story. It’s about using your imagination to create something that didn’t exist before. 
Creative art can be therapeutic and can help you express yourself in a way that you might not be able to with words. It can also be a form of relaxation and can help reduce stress. 

Whether you’re a professional artist or someone who just likes to doodle, creative art is for everyone. So get out your paints, pencils, or whatever else you like to use, and start creating!
