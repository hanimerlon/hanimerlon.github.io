Definition of innovation: How does it differ from previous generations?
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that is different from what has been done before. It can be classified into two main categories, incremental and revolutionary. Incremental innovation occurs in areas such as technology, business, and marketing; while revolutionary innovation occurs in areas such as science, medicine, and the environment. 
The definition of innovation has changing over time, but two main aspects have remained consistent: it should be creative, and it should be new to the market. Innovations should also be feasible to implement quickly and cost-effective. In order to achieve these goals, companies must have a clear understanding of how innovation works and how to define it narrowly or expansively according to their needs.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of making something new and different. It can be found in everything from technology to food to fashion. Innovation is what allows businesses to thrive and make a difference in the world. It can also help themarkable products and services.
But what is innovation? To many, it seems like a vague concept or something that happens behind the scenes. But innovation is actually a process that starts with a idea and runs until it’s realized. In fact, it’s often the ideas that don’t quite fit into existing models that are breakthroughs in innovation.

There are several types of innovation: product, process, service, and market research. Product innovation occurs when companies create new products or improve upon old ones. Process innovation occurs when companies come up with ways to do things better or faster than they have before.
