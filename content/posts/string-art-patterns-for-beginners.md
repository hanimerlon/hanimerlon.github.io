Invention and creativity are at an all-time high. Innovation is the process of coming up with new ideas or solutions to old problems. It’s what has made us civilization as we know it. And it’s what will make us the best for the future.

This has led to a rise in innovation and creativity, which is only going to continue growing in the years ahead.
