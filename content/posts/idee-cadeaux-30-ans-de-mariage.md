What are some bad ideas?
The following are some bad ideas that people come up with all the time. Some of these ideas are really stupid and not good for anything, but they get thrown around a lot and people think they might be good. So, here are some of the worst ideas:
1) Making cars into machines. This is a really bad idea because it will make the cars more efficient and faster, but it will also make them more expensive to maintain.
2) Giving away free stuff. This is another bad idea because it won’t help anyone and it’s going to make people less likely to buy things.
3) Creating welfare programs that only benefit the wealthy. This would be a really bad idea because it would create a lot of competition among businesses and it would drive up prices for goods and services.
4) making school harder than necessary.
