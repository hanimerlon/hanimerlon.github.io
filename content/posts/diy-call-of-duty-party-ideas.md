What makes a good idea?
Every idea has a differentiator and what makes a good one is always subjective. Some people might find the concept interesting, others might not. There are many factors to consider when choosing an idea, such as how well it will be executed, who will be using it, and whether it is something that users are already passionate about. 
One of the most important things to consider when coming up with ideas is whether or not they are big enough to warrant investment. If an idea is too small or unimportant to warrant attention, it will likely be forgotten or passed over. A good example of this was the iPhone app Gap which was only released in Australia but contained massive potential because users were already interested in fashion and had tonnes of feedback. Another example would be Square which was originally considered a payment platform but has since become a popular social media platform for businesses and individuals.

But like anything else in life, there are a finite number of ideas out there and it can be difficult to find them. That’s where open-source software comes in. Open-source software is a collaborative software development model where anyone can contribute an unfinished piece of codebase to help others build upon it.

Overcoming the challenges of bringing a big idea to life
There are many challenges that come with bringing a big idea to life. The first challenge is often just getting started. It can be difficult to take that first step, but it's important to remember that every journey begins with a single step. Once you've taken that first step, the next challenge is often keeping your motivation high. It's easy to get discouraged when you encounter setbacks, but it's important to keep your eye on the prize and remember why you're doing this in the first place. Finally, another common challenge is maintaining momentum. It can be difficult to keep moving forward when you're feeling bogged down or burned out, but it's important to push through and keep your energy up. These are just some of the challenges you may face when bringing a big idea to life, but if you stay focused and committed, you can overcome them and achieve your goals.
