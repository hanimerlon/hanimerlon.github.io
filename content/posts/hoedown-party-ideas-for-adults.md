2. Listen to music while you work. Many people find listening to music helpful when theyâ€™re trying to focus on their work because it entertains them without having to focus on what theyâ€™re doing.

What can be done to address them?
In recent years, there have been a number of proposals put forth to address the opioid epidemic. Some of these proposals include increasing access to treatment, distributing Narcan kits to civilians in need, and regulating prescription opioids. However, each proposal has its own set of challenges and limitations. Here are four examples:
1) Prescription opioids are highly addictive and can lead to addiction and death if not treated. 
2) The distribution of Narcan kits is difficult and often requires an affiliation with a specialty hospital or ambulance service. 
3) The regulation of prescription opioids is complex and often depends on the669 individual state laws. 
4) Addressing the opioid epidemic will require multiple strategies and interventions that work together.
