The different types of innovation: Research, invention, development, and production
Innovation is a process of making something new or different. There are three main types of innovation: Research, Invention, and Development.
Researchinnovation is the most common type of innovation. It's when people study something and then make a change to it so that it can be used in the future. For example, in the medical field, researchers study diseases and then develop treatments to help people with them.

Inventionis when someone comes up with a new idea for something and then does something with it to make it work. For example, somebody might come up with a new way to make cigarettes that doesn't use tobacco smoke as part of their product. 

Developmentis when somebody makes an idea into a reality by creating a product or service that is usable by people.

what are big ideas?
What are Big Ideas?
In education, a big idea is a broad concept that provides a unifying structure for a lesson or unit. It helps students connect new information to what they already know and understand. Big ideas should be open-ended and complex, allowing students to explore them in depth.

Big ideas help students see the world in new ways and make connections between different concepts. They encourage higher-level thinking and promote deeper understanding. When students can articulate the big ideas in a subject, they have mastered the essential content and skills.
