What is creativity?
Creativity is the process of coming up with new ideas, concepts or solutions to problems. It can be defined in many ways, but often it refers to the ability to come up with something new and original. Creative people are often thought of as those who are able to come up with new and innovative ideas, but that’s not all that creativity involves. In fact, creativity can also refer to the ability to approach problem solving in a different way or the ability to come up with innovative ways of tackling old problems.
