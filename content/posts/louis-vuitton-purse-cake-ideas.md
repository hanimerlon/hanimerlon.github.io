Invention process: How does an invention happen?
Invention ideas are a process that starts with a thought and progresses to the creation of a new product or service. The invention process can be described in four steps: Pre-production, Production, Market saturation, and Post-market.
Pre-production is when the inventor creates a rough idea of what they want their product or service to look like. This might include sketches, prototypes, or models.

Production is when the inventor makes the actual product or service. This might involve manufacturing it in physical form, shipping it to customers, and selling it.

Market saturation is when the public has become so familiar with the new product or service that they are willing to buy it. This might require creating more versions of the product or service, marketing them well, and making sure they are available at low prices.

2020: What were some of the biggest challenges and opportunities faced in 2020?
In 2020, some of the biggest challenges facing the United States and other democracies were the rise in populism and xenophobia, as well as economic volatility. However, there also opportunities for progress. The biggest challenge facing the US was the increasing support for secessionist movements such as the "Brexit" vote in Britain and the workshopping of a new tax code that would have lowered rates for businesses. Other key issues include Bureaucratic red tape, healthcare reform, and gun control. In Europe, problems including Brexit and population growth made it difficult to agree on policies to address these issues. Despite these challenges, there are also opportunities for progress. For example, in France, Emmanuel Macron has been successful in making his country more competitive by focusing on innovation and job creation. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is working to reduce social inequality by creating jobs in the economy.

The Future of Invention: There is an active field of research that is exploring the potential of new technologies and how they could impact future generations.
Innovation is a constantly occurring event in the life of humans and technology. It has been a driving force in human progress for centuries and will continue to do so into the future. There are a number of potential new technologies that could have a significant impact on society and the economy. 
One potential technology that has the potential to revolutionize how we do business is artificial intelligence (AI). AI is able to learn and grow on its own, making it more efficient and accurate at performing tasks. This could have a significant impact on businesses, as it would make it easier to automate processes and reduce costs. 

Another potential technology that has the potential to have a significant impact on society is blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed database that allows for secure transactions between parties without middlemen. This could have implications for many industries, including business, finance, and law.
