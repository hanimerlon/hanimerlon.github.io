Invention has been the backbone of business for centuries. When something is new, businesses can capitalize on it to increase sales and create new products or services. However, recent innovations have created new challenges for businesses as they try to keep up with the technology. For example, Apple's iPhone has made phone texting and talking on the go a must-have feature for many people. However, this has also led to increased competition in the market as text messaging companies such as WhatsApp and Viber offer better rates and features for their users. Additionally, Google's Chromebook computer is revolutionizing educational resources by making them more accessible online. These are just a few examples of how innovation can impact businesses in different ways.

Tips for post formatting and design:
1. Start by thinking about what you want your article to say. What topics do you want to cover? How do you want people to feel after reading it? Do you want it to be a tutorial, an overview, or a comprehensive guide?
2. Choose the right style for your article. There are many different ways to write an article, and there is no one style that is best for all situations. You can use a simple, straight-forward layout or you can go for something more experimental and stylish.

3. Use formatting features wisely. When writing articles, always use grammar and punctuation correctly. This will help readers understand your piece and stay on target throughout the entire process.

4. Avoid using clichés and other easy-to-spot errors.
