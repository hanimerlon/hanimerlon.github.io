The definition of art: What does art consist of?
Creative art refers to any form of art that is made for the purpose of making people or things feel good. In general, creative art can be divided into two categories: fine art and popular art. Fine art is more expensive to create and is often considered more significant, but it also has a higherbrow audience. Popular art is less formal and typically enjoyed by a wider range of people, including children.

Overcoming barriers to big thinking
It's no secret that some of the world's most successful people are also some of the world's biggest thinkers. But what separates these individuals from everyone else?
For starters, they're not afraid to think big. They don't let their imaginations be limited by what's considered "normal" or "possible." Instead, they allow themselves to explore every possibility, no matter how far-fetched it may seem.

In addition to thinking big, these individuals are also willing to take risks. They know that in order to achieve something great, they may have to put everything on the line. They're not afraid of failure, because they know that even if they don't achieve their goal, they'll learn something valuable in the process.

 Finally, these individuals are persistent.
