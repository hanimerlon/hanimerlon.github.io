Big ideas are the heart of any startup. These are ideas that could have a significant impact on the company and its customers, but might not yet be realized. Startups often come up with big ideas during their early years, when they are still formulating their business plan and trying to figure out how to make their idea work. Once they have a better understanding of what they’re doing, startups often start developing more detailed plans for how to execute their big ideas.

Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of bringing new ideas or products to market using creative and efficient methods. Innovation can be found in any industry, but typically it refers to technology, business, and product innovation.
There are many ways to define innovation, but one way that has become increasingly important is the definition provided by Matt Ridley in his book "The Innovator's Dilemma." Ridley defines innovation as a state of mind: "Innovation always means change, not just alteration of what has been done before." He goes on to say that innovation should be based on the following four factors: creativity, efficiency, novelty, and sustainability.

Creativity is a necessary component of any innovation process; without it, ideas will likely not make it past the initial stages of development.

Development of Invention: Inventions often come about as a result of a brainstorming session or a problem that someone is facing.
Invention ideas can come about from many different places. A brainstorming session might be the best place to come up with new ideas, but sometimes a problem needs to be solved in order to get started on developing an invention. Sometimes, a solution is just waiting for someone to stumble upon it.

The definition of brainstroming: how it works and what it can do for you
There are many definitions of brainstroming, but the most complete one I’ve found is this: “the process by which a person or organization achieves a goal by using whatever resources they have at hand, including their own brainpower and energy.” Brainstroming can be used for personal or professional purposes. For example, if you want to improve your thinking skills, you may use brainstroming to do so. If you want to become more organized, you may use brainstroming to help with that. And if you want to achieve a goal faster, you may use brainstroming to help with that as well.
