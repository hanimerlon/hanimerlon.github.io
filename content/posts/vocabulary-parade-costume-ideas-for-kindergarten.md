Brainstroming is the process of thinking about a topic excessively and not completing any tasks. This can lead to a lack of productivity and an overall feeling of being overwhelmed. It is important to remember that brainstroming is a mental habit, not a physical one, and should be broken down into smaller tasks that can be completed.

What is creativity?
Creativity is a complex and subjective concept. Some people find it easy to see how creativity can be used in art, while others might not see any similarity at all between the creative process and their everyday lives. What is clear, though, is that creativity is something that everyone experiences differently and that there is no one way to approach it.
