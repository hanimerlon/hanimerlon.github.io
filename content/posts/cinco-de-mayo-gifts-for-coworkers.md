Types of creativity:
Creativity is an act of thinking outside the box. It's the ability to come up with new ideas and solutions that don't always follow traditional procedures. 
There are many different types of creativity, but some are more common than others. Below are four examples of types of creativity that should be familiar to anyone who has ever tried them: 

1) brainstorming - This is when people come up with new ideas by brainstorming, which is where groups of people work together to come up with a solution.
2) problem solving - This is when someone comes up with a solution to a problem. It can be something as simple as fixing a car or solving a complex math problem.
3) creative visualization - This is when someone creates pictures or videos that help them think harder about how they want their product or project to look.
