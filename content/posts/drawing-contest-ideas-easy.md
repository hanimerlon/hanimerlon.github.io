Contributions of invention: What has been done with invention that has changed the world?
Invention has had a profound impact on the world, from the creation of dishes that could be made without cookbooks to modern surgical tools and vehicles. Some inventions have even saved lives, such as the polio vaccine. In recent years, however, there has been a surge in innovation in the field of invention, with new ideas coming out all the time. Here are some of the most innovative inventions of all time:
1) The first electronic device was created in 1861 by George Stephenson and James Clerk Maxwell. This was known as the Manchester Electrician's Watch. It was used to tell time and helped people stay healthy during health epidemics like bubonic plague.

2) Invention of combustion engine in 1879 by John Fenton and Arthur Couch. This allowed cars to be driven on paved roads instead of being pulled by horses or carts.

Decorating: How can you make your home look its best without spending a fortune?
There are many ways to decorated your home without spending a fortune. You can buy new art or accessories or make your own decorations with materials you have on hand. Here are some ideas to help you get started: 
1. Decorate the walls with art. Paint the walls in different colors and designs, add pictures, or use products like spray paint to create an ethnic look.

3. Add plants and flowers to your home in any way possible. Not only will this add decoration, but it also makes the environment more welcoming and stress-free. 
4. Get creative with window treatments and draperies.

Conclusion
Creative Art: The End of an Era?
For years, creative art has been a staple in society. Whether it’s paintings in a museum or music playing on the radio, art is everywhere. However, with the rise of technology and the changing landscape of the world, is creative art becoming a thing of the past?

With more and more people living their lives online, it’s no surprise that the demand for creative art is declining. With so much content available at our fingertips, it’s easy to see why many people are losing interest in buying paintings or going to concerts. With less demand, there’s also less money going into funding creative projects, which means we could see a decline in quality and quantity of art in the future.

That’s not to say that all hope is lost for creative art.
