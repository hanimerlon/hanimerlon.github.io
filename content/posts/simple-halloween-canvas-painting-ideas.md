Businesses and technology: What are the implications of invention ideas?
Innovation ideas can have a wide range of consequences for businesses and individuals. Some of the most serious implications are the way in which technology changes how we do business, the protecibility of technologies, and how new business models are born. Other consequences could be more mundane such as how an innovation can impact customer service or how it might change the way products are marketed. All of these potential implications deserve careful consideration as businesses scramble to come up with new ways to exploit new inventions.
