How innovation shapes our world
Innovation is the key to success in any industry. It allows businesses to create new products and services that stand out from the competition, and it drives down costs. In a world where innovation is so important, it's no wonder that companies arepushed to adopt it at all costs. However, while innovation can be a great thing, it can also have unintended consequences. For example, Starbucks today owes its success to its embrace of digital age coffee- drinking habits. However, if they hadn't embraced technology, their business might not have been as successful. In the same way, businesses must be careful not to overvalue innovation too much and stifle creativity. If done correctly, innovation can help businesses grow and change the world for the better.
