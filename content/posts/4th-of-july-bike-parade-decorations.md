What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can be a big help when it comes to solving problems. Ideas can also help you see things in a new light or come up with new ideas for projects. There are many benefits to having ideas and some people swear by the power of them. Here are three reasons why you should try out ideas at least once: 
- When you have an idea, it can force you to think about what else could be done. This can lead to new ideas, which in turn can lead to new projects. 
- Ideas are often more efficient than what is currently being done. When you have an idea, you can get started on it even if it’s not perfect and that makes the process of learning more efficient. 
- Ideas give people the opportunity to share their thoughts and opinions with others.

In a world where technology has taken over many aspects of our lives, big ideas are still important. Ideas that can change the way we think and work, or the way we live. With the new millennium coming to an end, it is important to rethink many of the big ideas that have been talked about in the past. One such idea is the idea of digital divide. This is the idea that there is a large gap in access to information and technology between wealthier and poorer countries.
