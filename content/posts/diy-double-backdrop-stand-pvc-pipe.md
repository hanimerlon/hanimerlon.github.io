Stop before you're too far: Sometimes it's better to stop when you're ahead of schedule.
One popular way to avoid becoming too far behind schedule is to take some time off from work and do things you enjoy. This can be done by either creating a plan or just taking a break. Other ideas for dealing with the feeling of being too far behind may include considering using a calendar app to keep track of when you will have other opportunities, setting goals for yourself that you can hit once you've caught up, or using a timer to keep track of how long it will take you to complete a task. When making decisions about when and how to take breaks, it's important to weigh the pros and cons according to what type of work we're doing.
