The challenges of invention: Describe some of the challenges faced by inventors.
Invention is often lauded as the key to progress. Indeed, many of the most important advances in human history have come about through invention. But what is often overlooked is the fact that invention can be a difficult and challenging process. Inventors must not only be creative, but they must also have the persistence and determination to see their ideas through to fruition.
