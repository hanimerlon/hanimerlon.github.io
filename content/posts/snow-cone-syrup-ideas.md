What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can help you achieve success in any field, even if you don't have a lot of experience. They can also help you get your idea off the ground and into a full-blown business venture. Here are four benefits of having ideas: 
1. You'll be more confident when starting a new project. When you have an idea, it feels like there's something to believe in. This confidence will help you start and finish projects with greater efficiency, and it will make sure that your ideas actually turn into reality. 
2. You'll be more organized when brainstorming new ideas. Having an idea always means that there's a potential solution that you haven't considered before! This will enable you to come up with better ideas for projects, faster than if you didn't think about it at all.

2. Make an easy suspension bridge. This project is simple enough that you can do it with just about any material you have lying around the house. Cut some pieces of wood out of lumber and lay them across the bottom of your child’s play fort or sandbox to create the foundation for the bridge. Then just glue someWrap rope around each post and you’re ready to go! 
3. Build an easy rocking chair.
