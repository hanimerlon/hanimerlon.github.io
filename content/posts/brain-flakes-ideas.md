Improvements you can make yourself: How can you make your home more comfortable, stylish, and energy efficient?
When it comes to making your home more comfortable, stylish, and energy efficient, there are a few things you can do on your own. Here are some easy tips to make your home more comfortable and efficient: 
1. Make sure you have an adequate amount of ventilation. draperies and window coverings should be able to let in fresh air, which will help keep you cool and healthy.

2. Add light fixtures and appliances that can be turned off when not in use. This will save energy and help keep your room looking bright and cheerful during the daytime.
