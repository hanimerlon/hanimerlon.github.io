Innovation in business: What are some examples of how innovation can be used in business?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or innovation that can solve a problem. Innovation can be used in business in many ways, from improving the efficiency of a business to creating new products or services. Here are some examples: 
1. Inexpensive home-theater systems could be replaced by more expensive models that use 3D projection technology to create an immersive experience. 
2. A company that produces respiratory masks could find new ways to market their products, such as using social media to reach more people in need and airing adverts on television stations across the United States. 
3. The production of chocolate could be improved by using insects as fermentation tanks instead of milk cows to make chocolate more nutritious and less costly.

What is brainstroming?
There is no one specific definition for brainstroming, but the phenomenon is typically defined as a state of high stress and anxiety caused by a combination of external factors (such as social media) and internal factors (such as personal thoughts or feelings). Brainstroming can be described as an intense feeling of focus, productivity, and clarity. It can be a great force for turning around projects and getting things done. However, it can also lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, and uncertainty. There are a few key steps you can take to reduce or avoid brainstroming: understand your triggers, set goals, and stay organized.
