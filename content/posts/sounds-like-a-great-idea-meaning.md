The different types of innovation: Research, invention, development, and production
Innovation is a process of making something new or different. There are three main types of innovation: Research, Invention, and Development.
Researchinnovation is the most common type of innovation. It's when people study something and then make a change to it so that it can be used in the future. For example, in the medical field, researchers study diseases and then develop treatments to help people with them.

Inventionis when someone comes up with a new idea for something and then does something with it to make it work. For example, somebody might come up with a new way to make cigarettes that doesn't use tobacco smoke as part of their product. 

Developmentis when somebody makes an idea into a reality by creating a product or service that is usable by people.

Invention: Limitations of invention
Invention limitations are a key concern for the modern age. Invention has played an important role in human society, and this is only expected to continue as technology advances. However, there are some areas where invention can be limited, which can have a significant impact on the economy and society. One such limitation is that innovation often begins with ideas and not with physical products or services. It is also important to note that new ideas often come from people who are not experts in their field and must work hard to develop them into a product or service that can be used by others.

Invention is the process of coming up with a new way to do something. It can be something as simple as making a new product or invention, or it can be something more complicated like creating a machine that does something other than what was done before. Inventors are often able to come up with new ideas at any time, and they are often able to improve on the original idea until they come up with a new and improved product or invention.
