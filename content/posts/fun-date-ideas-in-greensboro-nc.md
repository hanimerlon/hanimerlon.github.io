How to come up with a good big idea: How do you assess whether it’s a good or bad idea?
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things you can look for. First, is the idea itself? Is it something that could actually work or is it just a pipe dream? If the idea isn’t something you see everyday, it might not be as good of an idea. Next, is the feasibility of the idea? Is it something that could actually happen or is it something you think will only take a while to come up with? Lastly, do you have a clear vision for what the idea should be? Once you have all these things in mind, it’s time toevaluate whether or not the idea is a good one.

Patenting: What is patenting?
Patenting inventions is a process of claiming property of a new invention, usually through issuance of a patent. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) administers the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) system, which provides a single source for public information on the state of patent application and issue ceremonies. This information can be used to assess whether an invention merits protection and to create precedents for future claims against others.
