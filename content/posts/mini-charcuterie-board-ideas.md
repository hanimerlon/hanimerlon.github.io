What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of improving or creating something new. Innovation can be found in everything from small ideas to big projects. Innovation can help businesses succeed and create new customer relationships. But how do you go about finding innovative ideas? Here are four tips:
1. Take a Look at what Others are Doing: When looking for innovative ideas, it’s important to take a look at what others are doing. This will help you get inspiration for your own project and also gain a better understanding of the industry you’re in.

2. Use Your own Brainpower: The second step is to use your own brainpower. This means coming up with idea after idea until you find one that’s really different from what anyone else has done before.
