Overcoming blocks to creativity
When it comes to being creative, there are a lot of things that can hold us back. Whether it's fear, self-doubt, or just not knowing where to start, these blocks can keep us from coming up with great ideas.
But the good news is that there are ways to overcome them. By taking some time to understand what's holding you back, you can start to break through and come up with the creative ideas you've been wanting to have.

Here are a few tips for overcoming some of the most common blocks to creativity:

1. Fear of failure. Many people don't want to try something new because they're afraid of failing. But the only way to really fail is by not trying at all. So instead of letting your fear hold you back, use it as motivation to push yourself further.

2. perfectionism.
