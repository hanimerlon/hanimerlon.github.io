The history of invention ideas: How has innovation changed over time?
Invention ideas have changed over time, and as a result, the history of Invention Ideas is reflective of that. One way invention ideas have changed is in how they are created.  In the past, invention ideas were often based on scientific understanding at the time they were conceived. However, as technology advances and new knowledge becomes available, more and more innovation ideas are born from scratch. This new creativity allows for faster response tochanging needs and developments in technology.
One example of this new creativity is the cellular phone. Cellular phones were first invented back in 1984 by American scientist Neil Armstrong and his colleague Rick Stratham. The telephone was originally designed to be a basic communication resource for soldiers in war-time. However, after seeing how useful cellular phones could be for civilians, Armstrong and Stratham decided to create a product that could be used by everyone including business people and everyday citizens.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can help you achieve success in any field, even if you don't have a lot of experience. They can also help you get your idea off the ground and into a full-blown business venture. Here are four benefits of having ideas: 
1. You'll be more confident when starting a new project. When you have an idea, it feels like there's something to believe in. This confidence will help you start and finish projects with greater efficiency, and it will make sure that your ideas actually turn into reality. 
2. You'll be more organized when brainstorming new ideas. Having an idea always means that there's a potential solution that you haven't considered before! This will enable you to come up with better ideas for projects, faster than if you didn't think about it at all.
