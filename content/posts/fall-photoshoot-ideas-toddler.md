Invention: How does invention change the world?
Invention has changed the way we live and work, and it could soon change the world again. With new methods of technology coming up every day, it’s hard to predict how innovation will impact our lives in the future. But with some careful planning, there is no doubt that invention will have a large impact on society as a whole. 
For example, imagine a world where cars were not relying on gasoline or oil to run. Instead, they would be powered by electricity or wind energy. This would slash fuel costs and improve air quality around the world. 

Similarly, imagine a world without farm animals. We would be able to produce more food without them and reduce water usage because we wouldn’t need to pour water onto fields just to get food for our animals. 

 Invention could also have an even larger impact on our planet.

Invention and technology: How has innovation changed over the years?
Invention has always been a major part of human history. From the invention of fire to the development of cars, people have used their ingenuity to make new products and technologies. However, innovation has changed over time, as it has become more and more difficult to come up with new ideas. This is due to a variety of reasons, some of which are global in scope and others specific to each country or industry.
One example of how innovation has changed over time is in the field of telecommunications. With the advent of technology such as radio and television, people were able to communicate with one another far easier than they had ever before. This made it possible for businesses and governments to connect with a wider audience, which in turn led to increased profits and growth. However, while this change was beneficial overall, it also caused some problems.
