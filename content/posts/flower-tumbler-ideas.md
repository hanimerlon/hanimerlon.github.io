Definition of a big idea:
Big ideas are those that are so big and complex that they take up a lot of space in a piece, but are actually very easy to understand and implement. Some big ideas may be things like global warming, energy independence, or creating a more perfect society. Regardless of the complexity of the idea, it should be easy to understand why it is important and what could happen if it were implemented.
