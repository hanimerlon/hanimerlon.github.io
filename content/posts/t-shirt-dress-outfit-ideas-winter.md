What is the process of creating big ideas?
How do you come up with big ideas? There are many ways to do it, but the process is usually something like this: 1. Come up with a general idea. This could be anything from the beginning of your problem to the end of your solution. 2. research what others have done on the topic. This could include reading articles, listening to podcast episodes, or consulting with other business professionals. 3. define what you want your idea to achieve. Make sure this is clear and concise so you can focus on creating a great plan for making it happen. 4. come up with some specific examples of what you imagine your idea might look like and how it would help someone or something else. 5. come up with a timeline for when you expect to see results from your idea and how much money or time will be required in order for that to happen

Prototype creation
Inventors often have a great idea for a product or invention, but don't know how to create a prototype. There are many ways to create prototypes, and the best method depends on the type of product or invention. Here are some tips for creating prototypes:
If you have an idea for a physical product, the best way to create a prototype is to find someone who can help you build it. This could be a friend or family member who is good with tools, or you could hire a professional. Once you have your prototype, you can show it to potential investors or manufacturers to get feedback and interest in your product.

If your invention is more of an intangible concept, such as a new app or software program, you can create a prototype yourself using basic coding language. This will give you a chance to test out your idea and see if it's feasible.
