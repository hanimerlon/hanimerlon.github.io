The power of creativity: What does it mean for your business?
Creativity is a key factor in any business, and it can mean the difference between success and failure. Whether you’re working on a project or just thinking out loud, creativity can help you come up with innovative solutions that solve problems. But what does it really mean for your business? Here are six things to keep in mind when looking to embrace creativity: 1. It can help you attract new customers. When people feel inspired by your work, they’re more likely to invest in your product or service. 2. It can increase productivity. Having fresh ideas on how to improve your business process can lead to faster and more efficient progress. 3. It can help you build relationships with customers. By being open and sharing your ideas, you risk losing customers who are already loyal to your competitor. 4. It can help you shift focus from results to customer satisfaction.

The five types of brainstorming: open, collaborative, focused, problem-solving, and creative.
Brainstorming is one of the most essential skills for any business or professional. It can be used for creative problem solving, brainstorming for ideas for products and services, and more. However, not all brainstorming sessions are created equal. Here are five different types of brainstorming that can help improve your session productivity: 
1. Open brainstorming: This type of brainstorming is usually used when there is no specific goal to achieve or when everyone is free to come and go as they please.
