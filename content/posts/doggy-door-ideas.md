Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
Invention is the process of creating something new. It can be a new product, a new way of doing something, or a new process. Inventors are people who come up with new ideas and find ways to make them work.
The invention process generally includes four steps: coming up with the idea, developing the idea, testing the idea, and commercializing the idea. Inventors typically use their creativity and knowledge to come up with an initial idea. They then develop that idea by doing research, making prototypes, and testing their invention. Once they have a working prototype, they commercialize their invention by marketing it and selling it to consumers.

Inventions can be big or small. They can be life-changing or just make someone's life a little easier. But all inventions start with an idea.

Types of creativity: Solo, team work, creative partnership
Creative art is the expression of ideas, emotions, and thoughts through the medium of art. There are many types of creativity that can be expressed through art, but one of the most common is solo creativity. This type of creativity occurs when a person creates their own artwork without any help from a team or other creatives. It can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing and to work on projects by yourself. However, there are also times when it’s helpful to work with others in order to create more effective and efficientartwork. This type of collaboration can result in increased productivity and better results.
