How to Innovate
Innovation is a key term when it comes to staying ahead of the competition. By understanding how innovation works, businesses can develop innovative ways to stay one step ahead. Here are three tips to help you achieve success:
1. Look at innovation from a systemic perspective. When looking at innovation from a systemic perspective, businesses should take into account the entire supply chain and the entire market. This means understanding how products and services are used and what opportunities exist for improvement.

2. Try out different methods of thinking. When trying out different methods of thinking, businesses should experiment with different ideas and see which ones work best for them. This will help them determine which innovations are most important to their business and which ones need further development.

3. Be patient with your experimentation.

The drawbacks of brainstorming
In a work environment, brainstorming is often thought of as a go-to method for generating new ideas. However, there are several drawbacks to this technique that can make it less effective than other methods.
One drawback is that brainstorming can lead to groupthink. This phenomenon occurs when people in a group tend to conform to the same thinking pattern in order to avoid conflict. This can stifle creativity and prevent different perspectives from being heard.

Another issue with brainstorming is that it can be difficult to generate ideas when everyone is focused on the same task. When people are talking over each other and trying to come up with ideas at the same time, it can be difficult to have an organized and productive discussion.

Finally, brainstorming sessions can often be dominated by a few extroverted individuals.
