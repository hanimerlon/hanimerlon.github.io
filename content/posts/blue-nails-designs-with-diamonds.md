Attributes of creativity:
Creativity is a term used to describe different aspects of people, things, and ideas. Some of the key attributes of creativity include: 
1. Inspiration – When something inspires someone, it can make them want to do something new or to change their current situation.
2. Imagination – People with creative minds have a lot of imagination which can help them come up with ideas that are never possible before. 
3. Daringness – It is often said that courage is the first step in any journey, and those who have a lot of it usually reach their goals sooner rather than later. 
4. Passion – People who are creative often have strong passions for what they do and feel like they are working towards something special inside themselves.
