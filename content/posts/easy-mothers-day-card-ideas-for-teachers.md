The drawbacks of brainstorming
In a work environment, brainstorming is often thought of as a go-to method for generating new ideas. However, there are several drawbacks to this technique that can make it less effective than other methods.
One drawback is that brainstorming can lead to groupthink. This phenomenon occurs when people in a group tend to conform to the same thinking pattern in order to avoid conflict. This can stifle creativity and prevent different perspectives from being heard.

Another issue with brainstorming is that it can be difficult to generate ideas when everyone is focused on the same task. When people are talking over each other and trying to come up with ideas at the same time, it can be difficult to have an organized and productive discussion.

Finally, brainstorming sessions can often be dominated by a few extroverted individuals.

Outcomes of Creative Ideas: What happens when you use creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be really helpful in terms of solving problems or improving the quality of a product or service. However, they can also have negative outcomes if not used correctly. Here are five tips to get the most out of creative ideas:
1. Make sure your ideas are sound. It’s impossible to come up with great ideas without some form of understanding what you’re trying to achieve. Make sure your concepts are clear, executable, and likely to work in practice.

2. Take a step back first. While it may be tempting to take things one step further and come up with something truly unique, doing so could actually backfire if it doesn’t have a real bearing on the problem at hand.
