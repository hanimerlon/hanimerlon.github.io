How can this new idea be implemented?
There is a new idea that could be implemented in the healthcare industry that is called electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs are a type of online system where patients can keep track of their health information and see updated information about their care. This would free up doctor’s time to focus on more important tasks, such as patient examination and treatment. Additionally, it would make it easier for nurses to communicate with doctors, since they would have access to all the information the patient has on their record.
