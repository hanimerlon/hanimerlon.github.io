The role of creativity in work: How does creativity impact productivity?
Creativity is a key factor in work. By definition, creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas and innovations. This can be seen in everything from creative writing to product development.

Beyond just products and services, creativity also plays an important role in team productivity. When people have access to fresh and innovative ideas, they are able to come up with better solutions faster.

The importance of ideas
Ideas are the lifeblood of any organization. Without them, a company would be in trouble. They can be used to improve products or to create new ideas for businesses. But even more important, ideas are the engine that drives innovation and growth.
But what are they? How do they come about? And how do they affect our business?

Ideas come from all over the place. Sometimes they come from people who have had some great ideas, and other times they come from others who have had some great ideas but don't know how to put them into a product or service that can make money for the company.

Ideas also come from customers. Sometimes we get an idea from someone who is using our product or service, and sometimes we get an idea from somebody who is not using our product or service but thinks it would be a good idea.

The benefits of brainstorming
Brainstorming is a great way to generate new ideas, and can be done either alone or in a group. When brainstorming, it is important to suspend judgment and allow all ideas to be considered. This can help prevent “groupthink”, where people only consider ideas that are similar to what they already know. Brainstorming can also help people come up with creative solutions to problems.
There are many different ways to brainstorm, but one popular method is called “brainstorming by free association”. This involves coming up with words or phrases that are related to the topic at hand, and then using those words or phrases to generate new ideas. Another method is called “brainstorming by analogy”, which involves thinking of similar situations or problems and how they were solved.
