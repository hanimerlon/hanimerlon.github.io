Risks and Opportunities of Innovation
Innovation is one of the most important aspects of any business. It can bring new ideas and products to market, which in turn can save businesses money and increase sales. However, there are always potential risks associated with innovation. For example, innovation can lead to new technologies that are unproven or difficult to use, which could lead to errors or failures. Additionally, innovation can also lead to companies becoming too reliant on outside sources for their products or services, which could create conflicts of interest or problems with partner relationships. Overall, it is important for businesses to be aware of the risks and opportunities associated with innovation and make sure that they are taken into account when planning and conducting business activities.

Big ideas are what keep us going when things get tough. They can be something new or something that we've been thinking about for a while but haven't put into action. Sometimes big ideas come from someone else and sometimes they come from ourselves. But whatever the source, we need to think about how to put them into action.
