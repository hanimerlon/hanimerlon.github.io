Definition of Invention: inventions are the results of creative thinking.
Invention is the result of creative thinking. This thinking can be done in a number of ways, but the most common way to come up with new ideas is through brainstorming. brainstorming is an informal process where people share their ideas with one another, without any specific goal in mind. By doing this, you can come up with a number of new ideas that could potentially be used in a product or service.
What makes brainstorming so helpful is that it allows for creativity to freely flow. When people areallowed to go at their own pace and have unrestricted access to their thoughts, they are more likely to come up with new and innovative solutions. This quality helps inventions become more effective and innovation becomes more commonplace.

The role of innovation in business:
Innovation is a key component of business success. It allows businesses to change and improve their products, services and processes in order to meet customer needs. However, innovation can also be a challenge. Sometimes, businesses find it difficult to identify the best ideas for new products or services and implement them successfully. This can lead to disappointment and even failure.
One way to overcome this challenge is by taking advantage of innovative technologies. Technologies that allow businesses to quickly create new products or services are often more successful than those that require more thought or effort. For example, online tools that help businesses track customer data are often more popular than those that involve physical visits or surveys.

Banks, insurance companies and other large organizations have used online tools for years in order to keep track of their customers’ spending habits and investments.
