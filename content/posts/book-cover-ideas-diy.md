In 1876, Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail developed a signaling system that could be used to send messages over the air. This system, called the telegraph, allowed for communication between distant locations without having to rely on intermediaries. The telephone was created in 1877, when inventor John Ambrose Fleming developed a technology that allowed voice calls over the telephone line.

Conclusion: What does all this mean for artists today?
In the past few decades, creativity has become an increasingly popular word in the art world. This is mainly due to the rise of digital technology and its ability to allow for more creative expression.Today, artists have more opportunities than ever to express themselves through their work. However, there are some potential consequences of this newfound freedom that need to be considered.
One potential consequence is that people may no longer view artists as important or valuable members of society. This could lead to a decrease in patronage and investment from businesses and organizations that rely on creativity in their products or services. Additionally, it could prevent young people from learning about and learning from art as a form ofexpression.

Even though these consequences may be minor in comparison to other matters, they should be taken into account when making decisions about how best to support creative art today.

The definition of creativity
Creativity is a mental process which refers to the ability to come up with new ideas, solutions or products. It can be described in different ways but ultimately it is what makes us unique and makes us stand out from the rest. Creative art is often seen as an area where creativity flourishes, as it offers an escape from reality and allows people to become creative problem solvers. In order to be considered creative, an artist must have a strong imagination, be able to see things in a new light and be willing to experiment.

Examples: When can you use creative ideas in your work?
Creative ideas are great for your work. You can use them to improve the quality of your work, or to come up with new and unique ideas. Here are a few examples:
1. Use creative ideas when you need to come up with an idea that is outside the normal. For example, you may need to come up with an idea for a story that is different from what other people have written before.

2. When you have an idea that is not very clear, try using creative ideas to help make it more clear. Such as making the idea more concise, or adding images or diagrams to help explain it better.

3. If you have a problem with something that you are working on, try using creative ideas to help solve it.
