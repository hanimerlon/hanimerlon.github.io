Some of the most famous inventions include the computer, the telephone and theimplication machine. 
Invention can have many benefits for both the inventor and their customers - often they are the first to bring a product to market that offers a new and exciting solution. The key is to ensure that ideas are properly considered before they are turned into an invention - anything can happen in this process!
