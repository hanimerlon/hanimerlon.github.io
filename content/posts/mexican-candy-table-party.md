Analysis: How can you use big ideas to improve your business or life?
Big ideas are those which are so large and complex that they can be difficult to put into practice but could be very beneficial for your business or life. There are a number of ways to use big ideas, depending on the situation and your business goals. Here are 8 tips to help you get started:

Conclusion
After months of toiling away on a project, it can be easy to feel like you've lost your creative edge. Fear not! Here are a few tips to help get your creative juices flowing again.
1. Take a break: Sometimes the best way to get out of a rut is to take a break. Get up and walk around, take a nap or just step away from your work to clear your head. This will help you come back to your project with fresh eyes and new ideas.
2. Talk to others: When you're feeling stuck, talking to other creatives can give you some great ideas. Ask them how they overcame their own creative blocks, what resources they use and what techniques work best for them.
3. Doodle: Sometimes the quickest way to jump start your creativity is simply to start doodling.
