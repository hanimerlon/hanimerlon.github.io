4) Improved patient engagement and adherence to treatments

Definition of creativity: How do we define creativity?
Creativity is a relative term. Many people believe that creativity = doing something new and original. Others would say it's the ability to come up with ideas or solutions that no one else has thought of before. The definition for creativity has changed over time, but the process remains the same- coming up with new and innovative ways to do things. Whether it’s painting, designing, or writing, creative individuals have always been able to bring their A game to whatever they do.

The problem is that most decisions made by humans are based on self-interest and convenience. We often forget that there is a greater good at stake when making decisions, and it’s time for us to start considering this in our everyday lives.
