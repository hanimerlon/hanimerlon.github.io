What are the most important ideas for 2022?
In the next year, many important ideas will take place. These ideas can help to change the way we live, work, and play. Here are some of the most important ideas for 2022:
1. We need to start thinking about climate change as a public health issue. This is something that has been talked about for a while now but it is still not really grasped by most people. The more we remember this, the better equipped we will be to deal with it.
2. We need to start using less water in our homes and gardens. This could save us a lot of money in the long run and would also help to reduce our impact on the environment.
3. We need to use technology more effectively when it comes to communication and transportation. This could make life much easier for everyone and would help us reduce our environmental impact too!

Origins of innovation: How did people get inventive ideas?
Invention ideas come from a diversity of sources, from people who are just starting out, to those who have been working on something for years. But there are some key elements that are always in play when someone comes up with an innovative idea. These include the idea itself, and how it can be realized. For example, a person might come up with the idea of a new product or service, but may not have any clear ideas about how to make it happen. To get started, they need to have some conception of what they want their invention to do and how it could be used. From there, they can work on coming up with a way to make their idea a reality.
