With so much automation happening, it's no wonder that companies are looking for ways to keep employees on board with the idea of AI taking over work. Some companies are already using AI tools to help employees learn new skills and knowledge, while others are using it as a way to outsource certain jobs or reduce costs. Whatever the case may be, the future of work looks bleak without jobs.

Idea for a big goal: What is our biggest goal?
Big goals are powerful tools for getting people to work together and achieve common goals. They can help a team focus on its mission, and create a sense of purpose. 
There are many different ways to create big goals, but here are five tips for creating effective ones: 

1. Start small: Big goals can be created relatively easily if the goal is something that the team is focused on and knows it has a chance of achieving. However, if the goal is something more difficult or time-consuming, it may be more difficult to get everyone together around it. Try starting with something that everyone in the team can understand and achieve. 

2. Break it down: Once the goal has been identified, break it down into smaller tasks that each team member can complete successfully.
