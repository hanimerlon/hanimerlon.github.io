What are the big ideas behind your organization?
1. What is your organization's mission? What are its core values? How do you hold yourselves accountable to those values?
2. What makes your organization unique? How do you attract and keep talented individuals and teams?
3. Who decides what is important to your organization? How do you make sure that everyone knows and agrees with the organization's mission and goals?
4. How do you manage conflict within your organization? Who has final say on important decisions, and who can appeal if they feel their opinion is not being heard or respected?
5. Are there any Committee or Board members that are not elected by the membership, but rather appointed by someone outside of the organization (e.g., CEO)? If so, how does this affect the ability for members to voice their opinions effectively within the organization?
