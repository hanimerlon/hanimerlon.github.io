The impact of ideas
How do ideas shape our world?
From the thoughts in our heads to the products on store shelves, ideas are responsible for everything around us. Every object we interact with was once just an idea in somebody’s head, and every object will one day be replaced by a new idea.

Ideas have always been important, but in today’s fast-paced, globalized world, they are more important than ever before. With technology making it easier than ever to share and develop ideas, the impact of a great idea can be felt almost immediately.

Whether it’s a new way to make money, a better way to make a product, or a new way to solve a problem, the right idea can change everything. And as we continue to face new challenges and opportunities, the power of ideas will only become more evident.

How to do brainstroming effectively
Picture a room full of people, all focused on one task. They are all working together towards a common goal. This is the brainstroming effect, or the power of team work.
The brainstroming effect works because people's brains are tuned to multi-tasking. When we're focusing on one task, our attention span is limited and it takes longer for our brain to process information. This can lead to confusion and a lack of focus.

However, if we switch our focus away from the task at hand, our brains are more likely to revert back to their normal processing speed and be more productive once again. In fact, science has found that when we switch our focus away from a task for just a few seconds, the speed of our brainstems activity decreases by 50%.

The power of suggestion: How can creativity be used to create ideas?
Creativity is often thought of as a natural ability. But it can also be used to create new ideas. In fact, suggestion can be one of the most powerful tools that you have. By suggesting an idea to someone, you can increase the chance of them actually following through with it. Here are three ways that suggestion can help you get your creative juices flowing: 
1. Suggest a task that someone may not have considered before: Often times, when we think about creativity, we think about things that are immediately obvious or something that we ourselves could do. However, many times what we see in front of us is simply too daunting or complex for us to tackle on our own.suggesting a task that someone may not have considered before can help open up their minds and allow them to become inspired by something new and unfamiliar.
