1. It can save you money. When you do things yourself, you don't have to pay someone else to do it for you. This means that you can put that money towards something else - like your savings or retirement account.

2. It can be therapeutic. Doing something with your hands can be very calming and satisfying. It can help take your mind off of your stressful day-to-day life and give you a sense of accomplishment when you finish a project.

3. It can be a bonding experience.

-Create a petition: This is a great way to get people’s attention and show them how you feel about something. You can start by creating a simple Petition on change.org or any other website. Once you have made your case, offer anyone who will listen an argument for why they should change the policy. 

-Dare yourself: If you don’t know what you want or aren’t sure how to get started, take some risks and try something new. Take on an assignment or complete a project that isn’t immediately related to your current lifestyle.
