The challenges of innovation
Every business wants to be innovative. But how do you go about being innovative when you're small and new? The challenges of innovation are just as extensive as the opportunities. Here are a few tips to help you navigate them:
1. Keep your ideas open. When you come up with a new idea, keep in mind that there's always room for improvement. You might not have initially thought of it this way, but if your idea is good enough, someone else might eventually come up with a better solution or an even better way to do things. Be open to suggestions and feedback from others before you give your idea any serious consideration.

2. Don't be afraid to take risks. When it comes time to come up with a new idea, don't be afraid to take on whatever challenge seems daunting or even impossible at first.

Coming Up With Ideas: Offer some tips on how to generate invention ideas.
Inventing something new can be a daunting task, but there are some things you can do to increase your chances of success. First, try to come up with ideas that solve a problem you encounter in your everyday life. Chances are, if you can find a solution to your own problem, others will be interested in your invention as well. Also, don't be afraid to brainstorm with friends or family members; two heads are better than one when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Finally, keep a notebook or journal handy at all times so you can jot down any inventive thoughts that pop into your head; you never know when inspiration will strike!
