What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from changing the way you look at an everyday object to starting a new business. There are so many ways to be creative and have fun, so it's hard to know where to start. Here are some ideas for creativity: 
1. Make something that you've never seen before. This can be anything from a new design for your home to making your own clothing line.
