The Basics: How do you choose the right tools and materials for a DIY project?
When starting a DIY project, the first step is to decide what you want to do. This can be broken down into five categories: tools, materials, method, tools and techniques, and time. Now that you have an idea of what you need and want, it's time to choose the right tools and materials for your project.
Tools
Choose the right tool for the job. There are many different types of tools available which can be used for a variety of tasks. Make sure you have a good understanding of what each tool is used for before beginning your project.

What is innovation and how does it differ from other types of creativity?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas or products that solve a problem. It can come in many forms- from the invention of the telephone to the development of new drugs. 
One important difference between innovation and creativity is that innovation typically involves more than one person. In order to create something new, you need to come up with a solution that meets the needs of your audience and is unique to them. On the other hand, creativity often comes from within- people working on their own projects without any outside help. This type of creativity often produces more original ideas and products than those developed in collaboration.
