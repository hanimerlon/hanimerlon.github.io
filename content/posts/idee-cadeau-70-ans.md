Creativity is a key component of the creative process. By using different creative methods, artists are able to come up with new ideas and solutions that can help them achieve their goals. For example, when creating a painting, a creative artist might use different colors to create a realistic scene. Similarly, when writing poetry, the writer may use alliteration or other forms of poetry to make the words seem more interesting. In both cases, the artist and writer are trying to find ways to express themselves through their art.

How to brainstorm effectively
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few things you can do to make sure you're doing it effectively. First, it's important to have a clear goal in mind. What are you trying to achieve with this brainstorming session? Once you know what you're trying to accomplish, you can start generating ideas. It's helpful to write down every idea that comes to mind, no matter how crazy or far-fetched it may seem. You can always weed out the bad ideas later. The goal is just to get as many ideas as possible at this stage. Once you have a good list of ideas, start looking for patterns and connections between them. This will help you start narrowing down your options and come up with a plan of action. Brainstorming can be a great way to generate new ideas and solve problems, but only if you do it effectively.

Defining "big ideas"
What are "big ideas"? This is a question that has been asked throughout the history of education. The answer, however, is not always so clear.
One way to think of big ideas is as concepts that are essential for understanding a particular subject. For example, in mathematics, some big ideas include numbers and operations, patterns and relationships, and geometry and measurement. In science, some big ideas include energy and matter, waves and forces, and Earth and space.

The National Education Association's College and Career Readiness Standards also identify several big ideas in each content area. For example, in English Language Arts, the standards identify reading for knowledge and information; reading for literary experience; writing; speaking and listening; and language. In history/social studies, the standards identify civics and government; economics; geography; history;and social studies skills and methods.
