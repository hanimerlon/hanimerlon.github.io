The Role of Innovation in the Future of Business: What will be the most significant changes in the future as a result of innovation?
Innovation is a key part of the future of business. It allows businesses to make new products and services that can be sold to customers and increase profits. But with innovation comes risk, which can lead to new products or services not being successful and costing more than those that were initially created. Innovation also requires time and money, which can be difficult to come by in some cases.
But while innovation may be a necessary part of the future of business, it is not always easy to come by. In some cases, companies have to invest in researching and developing new ideas for products or services in order to bring them to market quickly. This takes time, money, and effort – all of which may not be available in other times or situations.

So while innovation may not always be easy to come by, it is an essential part of the future of business.

Origin of invention: Why was a particular invention chosen for development?
Inventions are often chosen for development based on a number of factors, including need, potential market, and other costs. There is an Origin of Invention story to be told every time a new invention is created. The story begins with the idea and then the process that went into making it a reality. 
Some inventions are born out of necessity; others come from pure thought. Sometimes, an idea just pops into someone's head and they start to see how it could be used in the real world. Other times, a team of experts put their thoughts together and come up with a great solution or innovation. 

The Origin of Invention story isn't always about bricks and mortar. Sometimes, ideas just take off in different directions after being studied and tested in various settings.
