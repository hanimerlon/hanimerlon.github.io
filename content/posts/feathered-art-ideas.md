How do we create big ideas?
Are you looking for ways to create big ideas? Here are a few tips:
1. Think about what kind of idea would interest you. Do you want to focus on a small project or develop a larger idea?

Origin of invention: How did somebody come up with the idea for a product or service?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea, or designing something that has not been done before. It can be anything from a simple invention to a groundbreaking product or service. The key to coming up with an innovative idea is to have an original solution that nobody else has come up with before. There are many different ways someone could come up with the idea for a product or service, and it all depends on what the person is trying to achieve. Some people come up with ideas while they are sleep, others work on them for months or even years before finally achieving success. However, the most important thing is that the person takes their time in coming up with an innovative solution.

Commercialization of an invention: What happens next?
Invention ideas are an important part of any business. They can be used to create new products or services, or to improve current ones. But what happens when these ideas are commercialized? In some cases, this can lead to great wealth for the inventor and their backers, while in others it can lead to negative consequences for the company or product. Here is a look at three examples:
1. Apple Inc.'s invention of the iPhone led toohlseaGapps (AIG) being created as a direct competitor, which in turn led to Apple getting greater profits and market share.

2. Microsoft's invention of the Windows operating system led to its rivals making versions that were more secure and easier to use than the original versions. This caused a decline in Redmond's market share and caused some criticism from users who felt they had not been given a fair chance.
