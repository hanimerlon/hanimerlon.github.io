Wearables: What are some of the latest wearable inventions?
Some of the latest wearable inventions include smart watches, sleeves that keep you warm, and even a smart coffee mug. With so many new ideas on the horizon, it's hard to know which one to try first. So here are four tips to help you make the best choice:
1. Check out what's in stock first: One of the best things you can do when trying out a new invention is to check out what's in stock. This will give you a good idea of what type of product might be available for purchase. If there's something you're interested in but don't see on store shelves, ask your friends or family if they have any recommendations.

2. Consider size: Another thing to consider when looking at wearable inventions is how large or small they might be.

Category: Creative Ideas
Creative ideas can be anything from the creative process itself, to how to go about creating something new. Whether you're looking for inspiration for a new quilt or a new painting, there are many ways to find creative solutions. Here are just a few examples: 
- Make your own puzzle book: This is an excellent way to get more out of your creativity and have some fun while doing it. Start by picking out some interesting puzzles to solve, then make your own book folder that holds the puzzles and their solutions. Once you've made one or two, take them around with you and show people what you've done! 

- Experiment with color: Just as with any other aspect of creativity, there's no one right way to do things. What works for one person might not work for another.
