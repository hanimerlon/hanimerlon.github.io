How to brainstorm effectively
It is important to know how to brainstorm effectively in order to get the most out of your ideas. Here are a few tips on how to do just that:
1. Relax and let your mind wander. The best ideas usually come when you’re not trying too hard to think of them. So take a break, go for a walk, or do something else that will help you relax.

2. Set some ground rules. Once you have a general idea of what you want to brainstorm about, it can be helpful to set some parameters for yourself. This will help keep your thoughts focused and prevent you from getting too sidetracked.

3. Write down everything that comes to mind. No matter how silly or irrelevant it may seem, write it down anyway.

The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it’s time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there’s an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that’s coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.
