What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a huge part of any person’s life. Whether you’re an artist, writer, musician, or simply thinking outside the box, creativity is a huge part of who you are. Here are some creative ideas to get you started:

Invention as an act or process of coming up with a new idea or solution
Invention has been around for centuries, and it is no secret that many creative minds have come up with brilliant new ideas. However, only a small percentage of inventions actually become products or services. This is due to the fact that invention is an act or process of coming up with a new idea or solution. In order to make your invention successful, you must be able to come up with great ideas and have the hustle and determination to work on them tirelessly. If you are able to put in the extra effort, your invention will likely be more successful than those who just sit back and wait for someone else to create something for them.
