2020: What were some of the biggest challenges and opportunities faced in 2020?
In 2020, some of the biggest challenges facing the United States and other democracies were the rise in populism and xenophobia, as well as economic volatility. However, there also opportunities for progress. The biggest challenge facing the US was the increasing support for secessionist movements such as the "Brexit" vote in Britain and the workshopping of a new tax code that would have lowered rates for businesses. Other key issues include Bureaucratic red tape, healthcare reform, and gun control. In Europe, problems including Brexit and population growth made it difficult to agree on policies to address these issues. Despite these challenges, there are also opportunities for progress. For example, in France, Emmanuel Macron has been successful in making his country more competitive by focusing on innovation and job creation. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is working to reduce social inequality by creating jobs in the economy.

Big ideas are a critical part of any business or organization. They help to spark new thought, improve efficiency, and create value for shareholders. But what makes big ideas great? There are a few key factors that can make an idea stand out from the rest.
Some big ideas come from people who have strong convictions and see the world in a different way than most. Others come from people who are passionate about their topic and have an uncommon view of the world. Still others are generated by a brainstorming session or a large group of individuals who share an Idea that someone else has put forward.

Whatever the source, when an idea is great, it has something special going for it that sets it apart from other options. This is why ideas are so important – they give businesses and organizations the opportunity to explore new possibilities and find new ways to improve their operations or products.
