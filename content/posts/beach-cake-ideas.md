Why do we need to have big ideas?
There are a number of reasons why we need to have big ideas. 
1. Ideas can help solve problems. A big idea can be a solution to a problem that wasn't possible before. 
2. Idea generation can make us smarter. When we have ideas, we can learn from others and become better thinkers. 
3. Idea management is important for startups and businesses. Having a good idea is essential for any startup or business, as having too many ideas will lead to lower productivity and less success. 
4. Idea theft is a problem! Not everyone has the same idea for their business or product and someone else may have an idea that is better than your own and steal your idea without you realizing it. 
5. Idea culture is important for businesses!

The benefits of big ideas
Big ideas are the life blood of any business. They provide a new idea or solution to a problem that can create new opportunities or generate new revenue. Big ideas are what drive innovation and creativity, and they can help companies grow and succeed. Here are four benefits of big ideas:
1. They inspire others to think differently about their own deeds and possibilities.

When someone has a big idea, it takes the pressure off them to come up with something original and exciting. This opens up more opportunities for discussion and collaboration, which can lead to better ideas and faster progress. It also gives people an incentive to take risks and push boundaries, which can lead to even more innovative products or services.

2. They foster team spirit.

Big ideas promote teamwork by giving everyone a chance to contribute in a meaningful way.
