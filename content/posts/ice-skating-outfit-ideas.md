The future of transportation: How will we get around in the future?
In the future, many people may want to drive themselves around instead of relying on public transportation. This is due to a variety of factors such as the rise in car ownership, the increasing number of trips people make, and the lucrative business opportunities that come with driving for oneself. 
Some ideas for how we will get around in the future include: 
-building more autonomous cars that can drive themselves; 
-establishing self-driving taxi services; 
-making it easier for people to buy cars that can drive themselves without having to take a driver's course or pay for a mechanic; 
- creatingDriverless Taxi Pilot Programs in various cities around the world; and 
-focusing on improving infrastructure so that it can support more vehicle traffic.
